## Sally's page

I'm using this page to show my visualisations of data from the collection of the [Australian National Maritime Museum](http://collections.anmm.gov.au/collections). 

One map [route taken by Oskar Speck](https://sallyfl.github.io/OskarSpeckKayakVoyage/) a German kayaker who paddled from Germany to Australia in the 1930s.

The data including place names, dates and related images were gathered from documents and photographs in the [Oskar Speck collection](http://collections.anmm.gov.au/en/people/details/6904). You can mouse over the places to see an image related to that place and click on the image to go to the Australian National Maritime Museum's collections site.

My new project will show [multiple voyages from the museum's collections](https://sallyfl.github.io/multiplevoyages/) but is still in development.
