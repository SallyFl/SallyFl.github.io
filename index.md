## Sally's page

I'm using this page to show my visualisations of data from the collection of the [Australian National Maritime Museum](http://collections.anmm.gov.au/collections). 

I have created one map so far. This map shows the [route taken by Oskar Speck](https://sallyfl.github.io/OskarSpeckKayakVoyage/) a German kayaker who paddled from Germany to Australia in the 1930s.

The data including place names, dates and related images were gathered from documents and photographs in the [Oskar Speck collection](http://collections.anmm.gov.au/en/people/details/6904). You can mouse over the places to see an image related to that place and click on the image to go to the Australian National Maritime Museum's collections site.

It is likely that there are additional places not included and also that some dates will not be accurate. Place names are recorded as Oskar Speck recorded them with current names where possible.

This map and related data shouldn't be taken as an authoritative source but as an example of learning to code using an historic data source.
