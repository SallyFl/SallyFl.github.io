## Sally's page

I am learning to code with D3 js to make visualisations using data from the collection of the [Australian National Maritime Museum](http://collections.anmm.gov.au/collections). 

My first visualisation is a map of a [route taken by Oskar Speck](https://sallyfl.github.io/OskarSpeckKayakVoyage/) a German kayaker who paddled from Germany to Australia in the 1930s.

You can start Oskar's journey by clicking on the start button and mouse over the places to see an image related to that place. If you click on the image you will to go to the Australian National Maritime Museum's collection site and can see more details on the image or object.

My new project will show [multiple voyages from the museum's collections](https://sallyfl.github.io/multipleVoyages/) but this is still in development and the data is test data only.
